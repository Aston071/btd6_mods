This mod is broken. old description:


Provides and easy way to modify the game's towers without writing any code

INSTRUCTIONS:

Launch the game and it should generate a bunch of files in Mods/tower_customizer/original

Copy the files you want to modify to Mods/tower_customizer/custom

You can now modify those files to change the tower's stats such as the fire rate, pierce or damage, or do something more advanced like give the tower a new ability.

After saving the files you edited, press shift+F1 in the main menu to load them.
