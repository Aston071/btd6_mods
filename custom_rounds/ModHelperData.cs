Close the game Go to the Mods/customrounds folder                   Now you can modify the text files to modify the rounds, using the list of bloon names.                     when you're done, open the game, go on the map selection screen and at the bottom right you can change the roundset to the custom rounds (the one with a potion icon). You should also see a bunch of messages in the console as the mod loads the rounds. If you get an error when loading you probably messed up while editing. Make sure there are no empty lines in the file. Remember to send the console log when asking for help. You can delete the customrounds folder to restart from scratch.";
