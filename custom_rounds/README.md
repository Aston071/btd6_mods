Launch the game

Go to the Mods/customrounds folder

Now you can modify the text files to modify the rounds. If you don't know what the bloon names are, they will be in the console.

when you're done, press ctrl+F7 to load them. You should now see a bunch of messages as the mod loads the rounds. If you get an error when loading you probably messed up while editing. Make sure there are no empty lines in the file. Remember to send the console log when asking for help. You can delete the customrounds folder to restart from scratch
