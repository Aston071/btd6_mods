Press F2 to stop first person mode.    once in first person, press keys 4 and 5 to rotate.    if the camera is too high up, use ctrl+4 and ctrl+5 to change it.    This mod has the side effect of making towers shoot by default even with no target, and they will no longer automatically target the bloons so you have to do that yourself.    This mod doesn't work with alch, sniper, spac, heli, plane, farm and sun temples.    if you want to use it with a dartling gunner, put the cursor at the top left corner of the screen before pressing F3 and avoid putting it over the track.";
