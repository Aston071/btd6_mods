Also, your towers will shoot 2% slower and their ability cooldowns will be increased by 2% (think of this as planned obsolescence). This mod is intended to be played in CHIMPS mode in the challenge editor, on an intermediate or beginner map. The \"retry last round\" button works, but if you want to restart you will need to go back to the menu and start a new game. Values can be changed in the settings, but the default ones should provide an interesting challenge.";
