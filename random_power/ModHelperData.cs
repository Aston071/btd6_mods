More specifically, for each tower a random number between 1.0 and 5.0 is chosen. Half of the time the tower's fire rate and value will be multiplied and the other half of the time it will be divided. This means that if you place down a base supermonkey, you will sometimes get a low tier tower that shoots fast, or a high tier tower that shoots slowly. Glue, ice, alch, village, farm, as well as all 000 towers are excluded";
